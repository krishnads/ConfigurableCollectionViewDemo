# KConfigurableCollectionViewDemo
You can fully configure your collection view to handle number of items in a row
Just define number of items in collectionview and all is done for you...!!!!

This control is used to fully customize collection view with dynamic number of items in a row. It has two custom constructor methods used for initializing collection view either from array of images or with all Images of a directory.
